Dijikstra's Algorithm
Analysis of the Dijkstra's Algorithm Problem
This problem involves applying Dijkstra's algorithm to help Professor Charlie Eppes track potential escape routes of robbers who have committed a theft and abduction. Let me break down the key elements:
Problem Overview
Robbers stole a computer science book and abducted a cashier
They were last seen at waypoint 1
We need to determine the most likely escape routes to potential destinations: 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, or 22
Graph Construction Requirements
Create a graph with vertices 1 through 22
Add edges only between directly connected waypoints on the road map
Edge weights are determined by traffic conditions:
Green road segments: weight = 1
Orange road segments (or partially orange): weight = 2
Task Requirements
Construct the complete weighted graph
Run Dijkstra's algorithm with waypoint 1 as the source
Determine distances to the six potential destinations
Identify the most likely escape route (lowest weight path)
Provide detailed implementation and solution

Complete Graph Construction
For a complete solution, I would need to:
Analyze the map image to identify all road connections between waypoints
Determine the traffic conditions (green vs orange) for each road segment
Create a comprehensive list of edges with their weights
Since the actual map image is not fully visible in the PDF, I can only provide the framework above and examples of how edges would be added.
Implementation Details
The solution uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue implementation via Python's heapq module for efficiency. The algorithm:
Initializes distances to all nodes as infinity, except the start node (1) with distance 0
Uses a priority queue to always process the node with the smallest current distance
For each visited node, updates the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found
Tracks the previous node in each shortest path to reconstruct the full routes
Output Interpretation
The solution would output:
The distances from waypoint 1 to each of the six potential destinations
The identification of the most likely destination (the one with shortest distance)
The complete path from waypoint 1 to that destination
Without the complete map information, we cannot determine the actual shortest paths, but the code framework provided would correctly identify them once the graph is fully constructed.
