Markov Chains and Page Rank Algorithms

Concept:	[Stochastic Process]
Collection of random variables indexed by time or space,
	representing systems that evolve over time in a 
	probabalistic manner
It provides a mathematical framework for modeling 
	phenomena that are inherently uncertain,
		Ex: Stock Prices, Weather patterns, or queue lengths 
These Processes can be classified into various types
	such as
	1. Discrete-Time process
	2. Continous-Time process
	3. Stationary
	4. Non-stationary
	
Concept:	[Markov Chains]
Specific type of stochastic process with the 'Markov Property'
	Which states that the future statre of the process depends
		only on the present state and not on the sequence of events
		that proceeded it.
	This is referred as a 'memory-less' state which simplifies
		analysis of the process, as it allows predictions
		based on the current state.

In general, Stochatic process - future depends on entire history 
			Markov Chains - rely on the present (and immediately prior state)

Markov chains are widely used in applications such as:
Predictive text input: For example, predicting the next word in a 
	sentence based on the current word.

Queueing theory: Analyzing customer service systems where the next 
	arrival or service time depends only on the current state of the 
	system.
	
Game theory: Modeling strategies in games where players' 
	decisions depend on the current state of play.
