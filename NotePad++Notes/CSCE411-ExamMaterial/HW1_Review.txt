Topic (1): Asymptotic Analysis
Key concepts:
    Notation
    - Big-O (&& Little-o) [Upper Bounds]
        Def:

    - Big-Ω [Lower Bounds]
        Def:

    - Big-Θ (&& little-ω) [Tight Bounds]
        Def:

    - Asymptotic Equality, ~
        f(n) ~ g(n) means lim (n->∞) f(n)/g(n) = 1

    - Logarithmic Asymptotic Behavior:
        a. change of base formula
        b. tightness of logarithms
        c. growth of n^(log_b(n)) compared to others

Exam Tip:
    Prep by proving asymptotic relationships
    using limits or bounding functions


Topic (2) Sequences, Accumulation Points, and Limits
Key Concepts:
    1. Accumulation Points
        Values that a sequence or its subsequences approach infinitely often
    2. Upper Acc Point
        Supremum of all accumulation points
    3. Lower Acc Point
        Infimum ...
    a. Technique:
        Break sequences into cases (even/odd n)
            evaluate limits and see patterns

Concept: Analyze sequences for oscillating behavior, convergence, or divergence

Exam Tip: Practice identifying accumulation points for oscillating sequences,
            especially those involving (-1)^n, floor[n / 2],
            or fractions similar to (n / n+10)
            ->Justify Upper/Lower Bounds

Topic (3): Summations and their Growth Rates
Key Concepts
    1. Use bounding (upper/lower) to show big-Θ relationships
    2. Recall the common Sum:

    This allows us to justify Θ with O and Ω.
