\begin{problem}[20 points]
  Use mathematical induction to show that when $n$ is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence
$$ T(n) = \begin{cases}
2 & \text{ if $n=2$,} \\
2T(n/2) + n & \text{if $n=2^k$ for $k>1$,}
\end{cases}
$$
is $T(n)=n\log_2 n$.

\begin{problem}[20 points]
  We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. 
In order to sort $A[1..n]$, we recursively sort $A[1..n-1]$ and then
insert $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1..n-1]$. Write a recurrence for
the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

\begin{problem}[20 points]
  V. Pan has discovered a way of multiplying $68 \times 68$ matrices
  using $132,464$ multiplications, a way of multiplying $70\times 70$
  matrices using $143,640$ multiplications, and a way of multiplying
  $72\times 72$ matrices using $155,424$ multiplications. Which method
  yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a
  divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm? How does it
  compare to Strassenâ€™s algorithm?

\begin{problem}[20 points]
  Show how to multiply the complex numbers $a+bi$ and $c+di$ using
  only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should
  take $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ as input and produce the real component
  $ac-bd$ and the imaginary component $ad+bc$ separately. [Hint: First
  study Karatsuba's integer multiplication algorithm.]

\begin{problem}[20 points]
Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search 
recurrence 
$$ T(n) = T(n/2)+\Theta(1)$$
is $T(n) = \Theta(\lg n)$. Clearly indicate which case of the Master
theorem is used.
