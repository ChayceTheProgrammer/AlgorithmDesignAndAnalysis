The output shows the fitted x-vals, (predicted) y-values, slopes, intercepts,
    and segment boundaries for a dataset fitted with two segments.

Fitted values: These are the y-values predicted by the model for each x-value.
    Notice a clear change in slope around x-value 50, reflecting the two segments.

Slopes:
    These values suggest a positive relationship between x and y in both segments,
    but with a steeper slope in the second segment.

Intercepts:
    These represent the y-intercept of each segment's fitted line.

Segment boundaries:
    The segment boundaries are at indices 0 and 50,
    indicating that the first segment covers x-values from 0 to 50 (approximately),
    and the second segment covers x-values from 50 to 100.
