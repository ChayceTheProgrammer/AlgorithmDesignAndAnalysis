Asymptotic Analysis Full Write Up
    and Perusuall summary

Book:
    #1 Given
        f(n) =  [n*ln(n) + sqrt(n) + ln(n) + 1517*ln(ln(n))] /  n
    Analysis:
        the limit of most of these terms will be 0
        when fraction is broken up (as n increases):
        a. sqrt(n) / n          goes to 0
        b. ln(n) / n            goes to 0
        c. 1517*ln(ln(n))  / n  goes to 0
        BUT the n*ln(n) / n
            turns into ln(n) which continues to grow w/o bound as n increases
        Thus f(n) has a growth rate similar to ln(n) as n goes to infinity

    #2 the n-th Harmonic Number H_n
        a. H_n = 1 / (1) + 1 / (2) + 1/(3) + ... + 1/n
        b. H_n ~ ln(n)

Video Notes:
Asymptotic 1
1) Goal: compare function f(n) with a simpler function g(n)
    that allows us to understand the [order of growth]
    as n→∞ (n approaches infinity)
2) We discuss
    1. Equality ( ~ )
        a. lim of [f(n) / g(n)] as n infinity = 1
            (f and g grow at the same rate as n becomes large)
    2. Tightness (theta)
    3. Upper Bound O,o
    4. Lower Bounds (omega, little omega)
3) Use notions of limits to derive asymptotic notation
    a. precise def of limit
